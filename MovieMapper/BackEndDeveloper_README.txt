Files Written by Me:
--------------------
Backend.java populates a hash table with Movie objects provided by the data wrangler. It then allows for the Frontend to call and retrieve movies based on genres and or ratings, with the ultimate goal of providing the user movie reccomendations. The Backend keeps track of selected genres and ratings and can subsequently sort movie objects using their avg rating.

Additional Contributions:
-------------------------
Assisted the data wrangler and frontend with catching and trouble shooting errors. Helped to facilitate meetings and discussion regarding the work that had and needed to be done. Assisted the integration manager with errors that occured while implementing their hash table alongside the newly constructed Backend.
